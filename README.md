# Prodigy_CS_01
This repositery is for my cyber security internship task1
This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool in Python. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places in the alphabet.

## Features
- Encrypt plaintext with a specified shift.
- Decrypt ciphertext using the same shift value.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git
